# Mind The Gap
Neural network model predicting price movement following a gap discontinuity originally built in R in 2008.  The original project was an implementation of a single hidden-layer neural network from scratch done in R.  This project is a port of the original project to Python and pytorch.

The details of the original project are described in the paper `docs/MindTheGap2008.pdf`
